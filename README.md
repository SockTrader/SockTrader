## What is "SockTrader"?

SockTrader is an open source cryptocurrency trading bot. You can use it to automatically buy and/or sell cryptocurrencies based on a strategy that you've programmed.
The strategy basically contains a set of rules that will define when and how the bot should act in the cryptocurrency market. These rules can be based on technical analysis ([what is technical analysis?](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/technicalanalysis.asp))
or you could simply tell the bot to buy/sell at certain price levels. In fact, it's up to you to decide the rules of the game!

The name "SockTrader" comes from web**sock**et based trading bot. Which means that SockTrader will try to make use of a realtime connection with the exchange. This has the advantage
that one can act very quickly in a changing market with low latency.
