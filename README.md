## What is "SockTrader"?
SockTrader is an open source cryptocurrency trading bot. You can use it to automatically buy and/or sell cryptocurrencies based on a strategy that you've programmed.
The strategy basically contains a set of rules that will define when and how the bot should act in the cryptocurrency market. These rules can be based on technical analysis ([what is technical analysis?](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/technicalanalysis.asp))
or you could simply tell the bot to buy/sell at certain price levels. In fact, it's up to you to decide the rules of the game!    

The name "SockTrader" comes from web**sock**et based trading bot. Which means that SockTrader will try to make use of a realtime connection with the exchange. This has the advantage
that one can act very quickly in a changing market with low latency.  

## Features
- üöÄ Realtime super-fast websocket trading.
- üìà 50+ Technical indicators. ([docs](https://github.com/anandanand84/technicalindicators))
- üåà Written in TypeScript!
- üåø Unit tested source code.
- üî´ Mutation testing for better testing quality
- üìù Paper trading a strategy on LIVE exchange data.
- üè° Backtesting engine with local data.
- ‚ö°Ô∏è Test & live reload your strategy in [our online dashboard](https://cryptocointrader.be/)!
- üö¢ Run SockTrader inside a docker container.
- More features soon..

## Use our online dashboard!
We've built an online dashboard that you can use to visually confirm all the trades that happened during a backtesting session. The dashboard
has a live reload functionality. So SockTrader will relaunch the current backtest once you've changed and saved the code of a strategy. All the trades
will be shown on the chart as you can see in the screenshot. 

Try it yourself:
1. Follow our [Quick Start guide](#quick-start)
2. Run `npm run web` and leave all settings as default. 
3. Go to [our online dashboard](https://cryptocointrader.be/) and test your strategies!

## Getting started

## Quick start

### Dockerfile
1. Clone the repository locally: `git clone https://github.com/SockTrader/SockTrader`
2. Add trading bot configuration: `cp src/config.ts.dist src/config.ts `
3. (optional) Edit `src/config.ts`
4. Build docker image: `cd SockTrader && docker build -t socktrader .`
5. Start container: `docker run socktrader --help`

### Local scripts
1. Clone the repository locally: `git clone https://github.com/SockTrader/SockTrader`
2. Install dependencies: `cd SockTrader && npm install`
3. Add trading bot configuration: `cp src/config.ts.dist src/config.ts `
4. (optional) Edit `src/config.ts`
5. Build project: `npm run build`
6. Run SockTrader: `node ./build/index.js --help`
5. Transform our candle data (BTC/USD Bitstamp) from `src/data` to a readable format in `build/data`: `npm run normalize`
6. Run backtest with the normalized candles and the simple moving average strategy! `npm run backtest -- --candles=bitstamp_btcusd_1h --strategy=simpleMovingAverage`

## Other available scripts
- `npm run test` run jest test suite
- `npm run web-dev` start development webserver with nodemon for quick & easy development 
- `npm run web` start webserver. Can be used for "live reload" using websockets

## Advanced
Load your own candle data of a trading pair of your interest: [Create a candle normalizer in "src/data" folder](#normalize-raw-candles)

Create your own strategy [Create your own strategy](#your-own-strategy)

## Normalize raw candles

### Add raw candle data
Download raw candles from a trusted source in json or csv format and copy this file to the `src/data` folder.

### Create a candle normalizer
A candle normalizer is a small utility script that is tightly coupled to a raw candle file. It will normalize the candles
from a raw csv or json file and output them in a generic format in the `build/data` folder. This normalization process
can be triggered by running: `npm run normalize`.

The expected output of a normalizer is a IDataFrame interface from [data-forge](https://www.npmjs.com/package/data-forge).
Each row in the data frame should respect the following type definition:
```
{
  timestamp: Moment,
  high: number,
  low: number,
  open: number,
  close: number,
  volume: number,
}
```

Redundant properties which are not listed in the type definition above will be ignored by the trading bot.
If you run into any issue, consider removing them as well by calling `.dropSeries(["REDUNDANT_PROPERTY"])` since we cannot
guarantee that it will still work in the future. Data-forge and moment are already included as a dependency and they are
used throughout the SockTrader codebase.

The following example will give you a good idea of how you can create your own candle normalizer. Make sure to put this file
into the `src/data` folder next to the raw candle files. Preferably with the same name as the candle file but with .ts extension.

Example:
```typescript
// src/data/bitstamp_btcusd_1h.ts
import {IDataFrame} from "data-forge";
import moment from "moment";
import path from "path";
import CandleNormalizer from "../sockTrader/core/candles/candleNormalizer";

// Be sure to go back to the src folder, since this script will be executed from the build/data folder!!
const SRC_PATH = "../../src/data";
const PATH = path.resolve(__dirname, SRC_PATH, "bitstamp_btcusd_1h.csv");

const parser = (dataFrame: IDataFrame<number, any>): IDataFrame<number, any> => {
    return dataFrame
        .dropSeries(["Symbol"]) // Redundant property
        .renameSeries({
            "Date": "timestamp",
            "High": "high",
            "Low": "low",
            "Open": "open",
            "Close": "close",
            "Volume To": "volume",
        })
        .select(row => {
            row.timestamp = moment(row.timestamp, "YYYY-MM-DD hh-A");
            return row;
        })
};

export default new CandleNormalizer(PATH, parser);
```
