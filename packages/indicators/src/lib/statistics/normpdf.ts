 * @summary Normal probability density function (pdf)
 * @description  Normal probability density function (pdf).
 * Returns the pdf of the normal distribution with
 * mean MU and standard deviation SIGMA, evaluated at the values in X
 *
 * Default values: MU = 0, SIGMA = 1
 *
 * @param  {number} x real value
 * @param  {number} mu mean value (def: 0)
 * @param  {number} sigma standard deviation (def: 1)
 * @return {number}
 *
 * @example
 * var x = [ 0.003,0.026,0.015,-0.009,0.014,0.024,0.015,0.066,-0.014,0.039];
 *
 * normpdf(1);
 * // 0.241971
 *
 * normpdf(0,mean(x),std(x));
 * // 12.7622
