 * @method annualAdjustedSharpeRatio
 * @summary Adjusted Sharpe Ratio
 * @description Sharpe Ratio adjusted for skewness and kurtosis with a penalty factor
 * for negative skewness and excess kurtosis.
 *
 * Adjusted Sharpe ratio = SR x [1 + (S/6) x SR - ((K-3) / 24) x SR^2]
 * SR = sharpe ratio
 * K = kurtosis
 * S = skewness
 *
 * @param  {array} x array of value
 * @param  {number} frisk annual free-risk rate (def: 0)
 * @param  {Frequency} t frequency 252: daily (default), 52: weekly, 12: monthly, 4: quarterly
 * @param  {Mode} mode 'geometric' or 'simple' (def: 'geometric')
 * @return {number}
 *
 * @example
 * var x = [0.003,0.026,0.015,-0.009,0.014,0.024,0.015,0.066,-0.014,0.039];
 * var y = [-0.005,0.081,0.04,-0.037,-0.061,0.058,-0.049,-0.021,0.062,0.058];

 * annualAdjustedSharpeRatio(x,0.02/12);
