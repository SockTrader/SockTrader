 * @description A risk-adjusted measure with free risk and Ulcer index.
 *
 * Martin Ratio = (Portfolio Return - RiskFree) / Ulcer Index
 *
 * @param  {array} x asset/portfolio returns
 * @param  {number} frisk annual free-risk rate (def: 0)
 * @param  {number} t frequency of data. 1: yearly, 4: quarterly, 12: monthly, 52: weekly, 252: daily (def: 252)
 * @param  {string} mode drawdown calculation. 'return','geometric' (def: 'return')
 * @return {number}
 *
 * @example
 * var x = [0.003,0.026,0.015,-0.009,0.014,0.024,0.015,0.066,-0.014,0.039];
