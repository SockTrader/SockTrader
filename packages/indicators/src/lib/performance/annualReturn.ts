 * @method annualReturn
 * @summary Annualized Return
 * @description Average annualized returns over a period, convenient when comparing returns.
 * It can be an Arithmetic or Geometric (default) average return: if compounded with itself the
 * geometric average will be equal to the cumulative return
 *
 * @param  {array} x asset/portfolio returns
 * @param  {Frequency} t frequency of data. 1: yearly, 4: quarterly, 12: monthly, 52: weekly, 252: daily
 * @param  {string} mode 'geometric' or 'simple' (def: 'geometric')
 * @return {number}
 *
 * @example
 * var x = [0.003,0.026,0.015,-0.009,0.014,0.024,0.015,0.066,-0.014,0.039];
 *
 * annualReturn(x,12);
 * // 0.233815
